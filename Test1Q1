#The above calculation is according to the P formula in the question. The below is to assume y(0.5)= rate between time 0 to 0.5 year( 1st coupon payment), y(1)= rate between time 0.5 to 1 year( between 1st coupon payment and 2nd coupon payment), i.e. it's not exp(-y*t) as in the above calculation, it's exp(-y1-y2-...yt)
