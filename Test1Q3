#Use the lm() function to perform a simple linear regression with gdp as the response and exp as the predictor. Use the summary() function to print the results. Comment on the output.

l1=lm(gdp~exp)
summary(l1)
#Comment: t-value of exp is large and p-value is small. So it's significant and should be included in the model. R-squared shows 28.79% of the variability of the response can be explained by the linear function. F-statistic shows the model or at least one predictor is useful.
#Fit a multiple regression model to predict gdp using the following variables: exp, epg, hpr, oil, gdpus, crd. Use the summary() function to print the results. Comment on the output.
l2=lm(gdp~exp+epg+hpr+oil+gdpus+crd)
summary(l2)
#Comment: t-values of exp,epg and hpr are large and p-values are small. So they are significant and should be included in the model. t-values of oil,gdpus and drd are small and p-values are large, more than 0.05. So there is no clear evidence of a real association between these three predictors with the response. They can be excluded from the model. R-squared shows 37.2% of the variability of the response can be explained by the linear function. F-statistic shows the model or at least one predictor is useful.
#Calculate the 5% quantile of gdp using function quantile(). The economy is said to be in a crisis state if gdp is lower than its 0.05 quantile, and in a normal state otherwise. 
#Based on gdp, create a factor vector for the economy state and name it state. Then put this vector in the dataset using the data.frame() function. For the state, fit the logistic regression model using up to year 2007 as training data period, with bci as the only predictor. Compute the confusion matrix.
